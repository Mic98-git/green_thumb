E-commerce mobile application.

The main objective of the project is to create an e-commerce mobile app where plant-nursery owners can sell their products and where customers can choose and buy them. The idea came trying to help people to enjoy a better environment, with their beloved plants, without wasting so much time finding what they need. We are presenting GreenThumb, that is accessible by both customers and sellers involved in the green world.
